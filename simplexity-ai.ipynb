       "### Summary:\n",
       "This research tackles a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL): training agents when rewards are infrequent. The proposed solution uses _Graph Neural Networks_ (GNNs) to model how an agent interacts with its environment. The environment is structured as a graph, where each node represents a state and edges represent transitions between states. The agent learns the best actions by looking at the local graph structure. This method helps the agent navigate the environment better, especially when positive rewards are scarce. The study shows that this new approach performs better than existing RL algorithms in environments with limited rewards.\n",

       "This paper explores how to control complex networked systems like power grids and communication networks using reinforcement learning. The authors introduce a _Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)_ framework. Instead of having one central control, they divide the system into smaller parts. Each part has its own agent learning to control its subsystem. This decentralized approach improves both the system's ability to scale and its resilience to failures in individual agents. The researchers demonstrate that this method works effectively on several benchmark networked systems, showing its potential to handle the challenges of large and complex networks.\n",

       "### Summary:\n",
       "This research focuses on _Offline Reinforcement Learning_, which learns from existing data without needing new interactions. This approach is crucial for situations where getting new data is hard or costly. The authors introduce a method that uses contrastive learning to distinguish between successful and failed attempts. By doing this, the system learns a better understanding of the environment, which helps the learned policy to adapt well to new situations it hasn't seen before. The results on benchmark datasets demonstrate this method's ability to learn robust and adaptable strategies.\n",
